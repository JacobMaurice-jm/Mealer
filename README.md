An Ottawa-based meal sharing application called “Mealer” where local cooks can sell meals to clients from their home. 

This application supports three types of users:

>**Cook:**
a user that makes meals at home and sells them to Clients.

>**Client:** 
a user that buys meals from Cooks. They order the meal through the application
and pick it up from the Cook’s home.

>**Administrator:** 
a user that receives complaints about a Cook from a Client and may
suspend the Cook if necessary.
